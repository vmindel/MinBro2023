# Intrinsically disordered regions of Msn2 transcription factor encode multiple functions using interwoven sequence grammars

Abstract:

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are abundant in eukaryotic proteins, 
but their sequence-function relationship remains poorly understood. IDRs of 
transcription factors (TFs) can direct promoter selection and recruit 
coactivators, as shown for the budding yeast TF Msn2. To examine how IDRs 
encode both these functions, we compared genomic binding specificity, 
coactivator recruitment, and gene induction amongst a large set of designed 
Msn2-IDR mutants. We find that both functions depend on multiple regions 
across the >500AA IDR. Yet, transcription activity was readily disrupted by 
mutations that showed no effect on the Msn2 binding specificity. Our data 
attribute this differential sensitivity to the integration of a relaxed, 
composition-based code directing binding specificity with a more stringent, 
motif-based code controlling the recruitment of coactivators and transcription
activity. Therefore, Msn2 utilizes interwoven sequence grammars to encode multiple functions,
suggesting a new IDR design paradigm for potentially general use.
